# mail_app (Simple Mail App/ Just Mails)

A new Flutter project for myself. Learning and creating a mail app for windows (maybe translate to iOS in the maybe far future) which has all the features I need, nothing more and nothing less.

I started it because the mail clients I used got updated and reworked, in my opinion for the worse. This wil be a simple replacement for viewing and sending email without any bullshit features I do not need like calenders, planners, or proprietary folders.

The project uses the [enough mail client](https://github.com/Enough-Software/enough_mail_app) for dart, this may change in the future as I only want simple IMAP and SMTP features.

In general I want support for multiple email addresses, options for showing unread at the top of the inbox, a shared inbox which combines the inboxes of all emails addresses, customization of the color pallet, and OAuth support for logging in.

PS. please don't spam my test email :laughing:.
